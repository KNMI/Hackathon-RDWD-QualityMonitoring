## Introduction

Here comes an introduction about our work in the innovation week. 

You can add bullets:
* first item
* second
* another

And add different headers:

# very bif
## bit smaller
### and so on

In the chunk below r code is included (also others are like python are possible)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(RSQLite)
source("inlog_testdata.R")

# sqlite = dbDriver("SQLite")

#con<-dbConnect(drv=RSQLite::SQLite(),user=name,password=passwrd,host="bvmlab-218-30.knmi.nl",dbfile="test_data")#

# tab<-dbListTables(con)
# results = dbSendQuery(con,'select * from tab')
# data = fetch(results)
```

## Test data

The test data is stored 

```{r testdata}
inputfiles<-list.files("/home/dirksen/Hackathon-RDWD-QualityMonitoring/data/testdata/",full.names = TRUE)
saveRDS(inputfiles,"data/testdata.rda")
cat(inputfiles)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
