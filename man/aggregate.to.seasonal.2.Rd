\title{Aggregate 8 am to 8 am data to seasonal sums}
\usage{
\method{aggregate}{to.seasonal.2}(data.container)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.container}{The R object containing all timeseries and metadata}
}
\description{
Since the variability is seasonal dependent we would like to be able to compare certain seasons only. The function takes the R object, calculates aggregates and returns this in the object, included updated meta data.
}
\details{
When data availability is below 80% in a season (i.e. >18 days missing), or a year (i.e. > 73 days missing), the aggregation becomes NA.
